                   (Travelling Salesman Problem With Genetic Algorithm)




    [ Abstract ] 

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) isa classical combinatorial optimization problem,which is simple to state but very difficult to solve. The problem is to find the shortest tour through a set of N vertices so that each vertex is visited exactly once.In this paper we provide overview of GeneticAlgorithm Which is used for solving the travelling salesman problem.We present crossover and mutation operators, developed to tackle the Travelling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms with different representations.we show the experimental results obtained with different standard examples using combination of crossover and mutationoperators in relation with path representation.

In this literature we provide the basic overview of Genetic Algorithm as well as Travelling Salesman Problem.The travelling salesman problem(TSP) is an optimization problem which is very simple at the point of understanding. It seems Like a very simple task but it is very difficult to solve. The problem is to find the shortest path through a set of points or cities or Whatever you may like to say and the only condition is each city is visited exactly once. The problem is known as NP-hard, and cannot be solved in polynomial time when the points are so large in number. Many algorithms have been developed in this case. Here we are going to use the Genetic Algorithm approach to solve this problem. And this is the main motive of this project.
